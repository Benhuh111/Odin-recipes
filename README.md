# Odin-recipes

I am currently on the Foundations course and have come as far as to
Project:Recipes. So far, I have learned about the basics of Git and
the fundamentals of HTML.

Next step is to learn about CSS and I will be coming back later to this
section to share my journey and hardships that I will be facing.
